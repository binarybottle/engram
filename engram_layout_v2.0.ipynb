    "## Why a new keyboard layout? <a name=\"why\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal history** <br>\n",
    "In the future, I hope to include an engaging rationale for why I took on this challenge.\n",
    "Suffice to say I love solving problems, and I have battled repetitive strain injury \n",
    "ever since I worked on an old DEC workstation at the MIT Media Lab while composing \n",
    "my thesis back in the 1990s.\n",
    "I have experimented with a wide variety of human interface technologies over the years --\n",
    "voice dictation, one-handed keyboard, keyless keyboard, foot mouse, and ergonomic keyboards \n",
    "like the Kinesis Advantage and [Ergodox](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/APXBR/latest/0) keyboards with different key switches.\n",
    "While these technologies can significantly improve comfort and reduce strain, \n",
    "if you have to type on a keyboard, it can only help to use a key layout optimized according to sound ergonomics principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used different key layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, etc.)\n",
    "for communications and for writing and programming projects,\n",
    "and have primarily relied on Colemak for the last 10 years. \n",
    "**I find that most to all of these key layouts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demand too much strain on tendons\n",
    "    - *strenuous lateral extension of the index and little fingers*\n",
    "- Ignore the ergonomics of the human hand\n",
    "    - *different finger strengths*\n",
    "    - *different finger lengths*\n",
    "    - *natural roundedness of the hand*\n",
    "    - *easier for shorter fingers to reach below than above longer fingers*\n",
    "    - *easier for longer fingers to reach above than below shorter fingers*\n",
    "    - *ease of little-to-index finger rolls vs. reverse*\n",
    "- Over-emphasize alternation between hands and under-emphasize same-hand, different-finger transitions\n",
    "    - *same-row, adjacent finger transitions are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "    - *little-to-index finger rolls are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "\n",
    "While I used ergonomics principles outlined below and the accompanying code to help generate the Engram layout,\n",
    "I also relied on massive bigram frequency data for the English language. \n",
    "if one were to follow the procedure below and use a different set of bigram frequencies for another language or text corpus,\n",
    "they could create a variant of the Engram layout, say \"Engram-French\", better suited to the French language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Why \"Engram\"?** <br>\n",
    "The name is a pun, referring both to \"n-gram\", letter permutations and their frequencies that are used to compute the Engram layout, and \"engram\", or memory trace, the postulated change in neural tissue to account for the persistence of memory, as a nod to my attempt to make this layout easy to remember."

To establish which layouts are within a small difference of each other when using the speed matrix, we define an epsilon equal to 131.58 ms for a single bigram (of the 32^2 possible bigrams), where 131.58 ms is the fastest measured digraph tapping speed (30,000/228 = 131.58 ms) recorded in the above study.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we use interkey speed estimates to independently corroborate the practical utility of our top-scoring initialized layouts and variants generated from our candidate winner, the question arises whether a better layout could be generated using the above procedure and based solely on interkey speed estimates. To do this, we simply set apply_strength=False and Factors24x24=Speed24x24 and ran Steps 1 through 3 above. The resulting layouts have two to three times higher same-finger bigram frequencies, which is not a good sign of the ease with which they can be typed. This indirectly demonstrates that fast-to-type layouts do not necessarily translate to less strenuous layouts.\n",

    "### Add punctuation keys and number keys\n",

    "We will assign the most frequent punctuation according to Sun, et al (2018) to the six keys in the middle two columns:  . , \" ' - ? ; : () ! _\n",
    "\n",
    "            B Y O U  '   \"   L D W V Z\n",

    "            G X J K  -_  ?!  R M F P\n",
    " \n",
    "**Separating marks (left)**: The comma separates text in lists; the semicolon can be used in place of the comma to separate items in a list (especially if these items contain commas); open parenthesis sets off an explanatory word, phrase, or sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Joining marks (left)**: The apostrophe joins words as contractions; the hyphen joins words as compounds; the underscore joins words in cases where whitespace characters are not permitted (such as in variables or file names). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Closing marks (right)**: A sentence usually ends with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. The colon ends one statement but precedes the following: an explanation, quotation, list, etc. Double quotes and close parenthesis closes a word, clause, or sentence separated by an open parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number keys**: \n",
    "The numbers are flanked to the left and right by [square brackets], and {curly brackets} accessed by the Shift key. Each of the numbers is paired with a mathematical or logic symbol accessed by the Shift key:\n",

    "    { | = ~ +   <  >   ^ & % * } \\\n",
    "    [ 1 2 3 4   5  6   7 8 9 0 ] /\n",
    "\n",
    "    1: | (vertical bar or \"pipe\" represents the logical OR operator: 1 stroke, looks like the number one)\n",
    "    2: = (equal: 2 strokes, like the Chinese character for \"2\")\n",
    "    3: ~ (tilde: \"almost equal\", often written with 3 strokes, like the Chinese character for \"3\")\n",
    "    4: + (plus: has four quadrants; resembles \"4\")\n",
    "    5 & 6: < > (\"less/greater than\"; these angle brackets are directly above the other bracket keys)\n",
    "    7: ^ (caret for logical XOR operator as well as exponentiation; resembles \"7\")\n",
    "    8: & (ampersand: logical AND operator; resembles \"8\")\n",
    "    9: % (percent: related to division; resembles \"9\")\n",

    "\n",
    "The three remaining keys in many common keyboards (flanking the upper right hand corner Backspace key) are displaced in special keyboards, such as the Kinesis Advantage and Ergodox. For the top right key, we will assign the forward slash and backslash: / \\\\. For the remaining two keys, we will assign two symbols that in modern usage have significance in social media: the hash/pound sign and the \"at sign\". The hash or hashtag identifies digital content on a specific topic (the Shift key accesses the dollar sign). The \"at sign\" identifies a location or affiliation (such as in email addresses) and acts as a \"handle\" to identify users in popular social media platforms and online forums.\n",
