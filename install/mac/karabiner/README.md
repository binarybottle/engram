## Using Karabiner with Engram

To use the vanilla Engram layout on MacOS, simply

1. Install Karabiner `brew install karabiner-elements` (you'll have to grant necessary permissions in `System Settings`, detailed on the [Karabiner website](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org)).
2. Click this link to open the Engram layout [directly in Karabiner](https://esm.sh/gh/binarybottle/engram/install/mac/karabiner/install_engram.html)

Or you can view the JSON [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binarybottle/engram/master/install/mac/karabiner/engram.json) (you'll need to place the json file in `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/` and maybe restart Karabiner if you want to customize/ install manually).


## Using a karabiner.json Generator

This directory also includes [Karabiner.ts](https://github.com/evan-liu/karabiner.ts) config, as well as a [Goku](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo) config.


## Home Row Mods

Home row mods don't work very well in Karabiner. If you are interested in using home row mods on MacOS, you'll probably be happier installing KMonad, also documented in the `engram/install/mac` directory.
