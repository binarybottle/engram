# iOS Implementation

Using a small iOS app called [xKeyboard - Custom Keyboard](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xkeyboard-custom-keyboard/id1440245962) by 煦 张, it is possible to create a custom on-screen layout for iOS.

Try the following:

1. Download the `.xkeyboard` file in this directory to your iOS device.
   
2. Install [xKeyboard - Custom Keyboard](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xkeyboard-custom-keyboard/id1440245962) on your iOS device using the App Store.

3. Use the in-app purchase to upgrade to the paid version. (Required to be able to install from an `.xkeyboard` file.)

4. In the bottom row of buttons in xKeyboard, tap `Keyboards` (the middle button).

5. In the upper right corner, tap the `+` button, then `Import .xkeyboard`.
   
6. Navigate to the `.xkeyboard` file you downloaded in step 1, and tap to install.

7. Go to `Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard` and tap `xKeyboard`.

8. Now you can use the globe in any app to switch to your Engram layout. 


 There aro layouts for both iPhone and iPad, including portrait and landscape variations.

xKeyboard has a feature called "candidate keys" that allows you to press a key and get additional functionality. The iPhone layout uses candidate keys to collapse the center punctuation column on portrait iPhone view. They don't work quite as well as the native keyboard's flick-you kinda have to wait for the candidates to pop up. The dictionary and auto insertion of apostrophe's is also sorely missing. So the layout is slightly modified, but things are fitting ok on iPhone, and very well on iPad.
