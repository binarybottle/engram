    "## Why a new key layout? <a name=\"why\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal history** <br>\n",
    "In the future, I hope to include an engaging rationale for why I took on this challenge.\n",
    "Suffice to say I love solving problems, and I have battled repetitive strain injury \n",
    "ever since I worked on an old DEC workstation at the MIT Media Lab while composing \n",
    "my thesis back in the 1990s.\n",
    "I have experimented with a wide variety of human interface technologies over the years --\n",
    "voice dictation, one-handed keyboard, keyless keyboard, foot mouse, and ergonomic keyboards \n",
    "like the Kinesis Advantage and Ergodox keyboards with different key switches.\n",
    "While these technologies can significantly improve comfort and reduce strain, \n",
    "an optimized key layout can only help when typing on ergonomic or standard keyboards. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used different key layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, etc.)\n",
    "for communications and for writing and programming projects,\n",
    "and have primarily relied on Colemak for the last 10 years. \n",
    "**I find that most to all of these key layouts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demand too much strain on tendons\n",
    "    - *strenuous lateral extension of the index and little fingers*\n",
    "- Ignore the ergonomics of the human hand\n",
    "    - *different finger strengths*\n",
    "    - *different finger lengths*\n",
    "    - *natural roundedness of the hand*\n",
    "    - *home row easier than upper row for shorter fingers*\n",
    "    - *home row easier than lower row for longer fingers*\n",
    "    - *ease of little-to-index finger rolls vs. reverse*\n",
    "- Over-emphasize alternation between hands and under-emphasize same-hand, different-finger transitions\n",
    "    - *same-row, adjacent finger transitions are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "    - *little-to-index finger rolls are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "\n",
    "While I used ergonomic principles outlined below and the accompanying code to help generate the Engram layout,\n",
    "I also relied on massive bigram frequency data for the English language. \n",
    "if one were to follow the procedure below and use a different set of bigram frequencies for another language or text corpus,\n",
    "they could create a variant of the Engram layout, say \"Engram-French\", better suited to the French language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Why \"Engram\"?** <br>\n",
    "The name is a pun, referring both to \"n-gram\", letter permutations and their frequencies that are used to compute the Engram layout, and \"engram\", or memory trace, the postulated change in neural tissue to account for the persistence of memory, as a nod to my attempt to make this layout easy to remember."

    "Despite the fact that the Engram layout was designed to reduce strain and discomfort, not specifically to increase speed or reduce finger travel from the home row, it scores higher than all other key layouts (Colemak, Dvorak, QWERTY, etc.) for some large, representative, publicly available data (all text sources are listed below and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/binarybottle/text_data)). Below are tables of different prominent key layouts scored using the Engram Scoring Model (detailed below), and generated by the online [Keyboard Layout Analyzer](http://patorjk.com/keyboard-layout-analyzer/) (KLA):\n",

    "1.  Deviation from the balance of hand and finger loads should be as low as possible.\n",
    "2.  Percentage of tapping with the same fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "3.  Percentage of tapping that includes top row should be as low as possible.\n",
    "4.  Percentage of tapping that includes bottom row should be as low as possible.\n",
    "5.  Percentage of tapping in the home row should be as high as possible.\n",
    "6.  Percentage of tapping by alternating hands should be as high as possible.\n",
    "7.  Percentage of hurdles with the same finger should be as low as possible.\n",
    "8.  Percentage of hurdles with adjacent fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "9.  Percentage of hurdles with remote fingers should be as low as possible.\n",

    "(A) 1,6.    Alternate between hands and balance finger loads. <br>\n",
    "(B) 2,7,10. Avoid using the same finger. <br>\n",

    "(D) 7,8,9.  Avoid skipping over the home row (\"hurdling\"). <br>\n",
    "(E) 10,11.  Avoid tapping adjacent rows (\"reaching\") with (same or) adjacent fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The approach here advocates the following related criteria (see above for complete list):\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Promote alternating between hands over uncomfortable transitions with the same hand.\n",
    "8.  Promote little-to-index-finger roll-ins over index-to-little-finger roll_outs.\n",
    "9.  Avoid stretching shorter fingers up and longer fingers down.\n",
    "10. Avoid using the same finger.\n",
    "11. Avoid the upper and lower rows.\n",
