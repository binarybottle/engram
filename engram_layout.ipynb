    "1.  Deviation from the balance of hand and finger loads should be as low as possible.\n",
    "2.  Percentage of tapping with the same fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "3.  Percentage of tapping that includes top row should be as low as possible.\n",
    "4.  Percentage of tapping that includes bottom row should be as low as possible.\n",
    "5.  Percentage of tapping in the home row should be as high as possible.\n",
    "6.  Percentage of tapping by alternating hands should be as high as possible.\n",
    "7.  Percentage of hurdles with the same finger should be as low as possible.\n",
    "8.  Percentage of hurdles with adjacent fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "9.  Percentage of hurdles with remote fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "10. Percentage of reach with the same finger should be as low as possible.\n",
    "11. Percentage of reach with adjacent fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synopsis of above criteria for pairwise key presses when touch typing:\n",
    "(A) 1,6.    Alternate between hands and balance finger loads. <br>\n",
    "(B) 2,7,10. Avoid using the same finger. <br>\n",
    "(C) 3,4,5.  Avoid the upper and lower rows. <br>\n",
    "(D) 7,8,9.  Avoid skipping over the home row (\"hurdling\"). <br>\n",
    "(E) 10,11.  Avoid tapping adjacent rows (\"reaching\") with (same or) adjacent fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The approach here advocates the following related criteria (see above for complete list):\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Promote alternating between hands over uncomfortable transitions with the same hand.\n",
    "8.  Promote little-to-index-finger roll-ins over index-to-little-finger roll_outs.\n",
    "9.  Avoid stretching shorter fingers up and longer fingers down.\n",
    "10. Avoid using the same finger.\n",
    "11. Avoid the upper and lower rows.\n",
    "12. Avoid skipping over the home row.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to account for (A-E) by the rules to generate the Flow24x24 matrix. \n",
    "Additionally, left/right balance for (A) will be accounted for in part by\n",
    "splitting up the most common keeps to left and right sides of the keyboard, \n",
    "and rather than try to balance finger loads equally,\n",
    "we will weight finger use according to their relative strength."

    "## Step 1: Arrange the most frequent letters based on comfort and bigram frequencies  <a name=\"step1\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assign letters to the most comfortable keys within a layout of 24 finger-column keys. These columns require no lateral finger movements when touch typing (see below). The most comfortable keys include the left and right home rows (keys 5-8 and 17-20), the top-center keys that allow the longer middle and ring fingers to uncurl upwards (keys 2,3 and 14,15), as well as the shorter fingers to curl downwards (keys 9,12 and 21,24). We will reserve the bottom left row (keys 9-12) for common command shortcut letters (Z,X,C,V):\n",

    "    [9 10 11 12]      21 22 23 24\n",
    "\n",
    "In prior experiments, all of the vowels clustered together on the left side, due in part to suboptimal consonant-vowel arrangements. We will therefore begin by assigning the five vowels to the most comfortable keys on the left. We will assign the letter E, the most frequent in the English language, to either of the strongest keys (7 and 8, the middle and index fingers on the home row). \n",
    "\n",
    "**E**, T, **A, O, I**, N, S, R, H, L, D, [C], **U**, M, F, P, G, W, Y, B, [V], K, [X], J, Q, [Z]\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will arrange the five vowels so that any top-frequency bigram (more than 1 billion instances in Peter Norvig's analysis of Google data) reads from left to right (ex: TH, not HT). Finally, we will allow the least frequent vowel, U, to be assigned to the less comfortable key 4 (index finger on the upper row). With the above constraints, we generate the following layouts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (1)  -  -  U  - \n",
    "         I  O  E  A      \n",
    "\n",
    "    (2)  -  O  U  -\n",
    "         I  -  E  A    \n",

    "         I  O  E  A      \n",

    "    (6)  -  I  O  U    \n",
    "         -  -  E  A     \n",
    "\n",
    "If we examine the relative comfort of all 2-vowel bigrams with frequencies >1 billion (x = uncomfortable; o = same finger), then we determine that at least one layout (6) can be omitted from further analysis, due to the discomfort of typing the fourth most common 2-vowel bigram, IE. One has to uncurl upwards the shorter ring finger and curl downwards the longer middle finger. Similarly, layout (2) makes it uncomfortable to type OE, but this is a less common bigram, so we will include this layout in further analyses:\n",
