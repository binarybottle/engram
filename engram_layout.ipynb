    "1.  Deviation from the balance of hand and finger loads should be as low as possible.\n",
    "2.  Percentage of tapping with the same fingers should be as low as possible.\n",

    "6.  Percentage of tapping by alternating hands should be as high as possible.\n",
    "7.  Percentage of hurdles with the same finger should be as low as possible.\n",
    "8.  Percentage of hurdles with adjacent fingers should be as low as possible.\n",

    "(E) 10,11.  Avoid tapping adjacent rows (\"reaching\") with (same or) adjacent fingers.\n",

    "#### The approach here advocates the following related criteria (see above for complete list):\n",
    "  7.  Promote alternating between hands over typing with the same hand. <br>\n",
    "  8.  Promote little-to-index-finger roll-ins over index-to-little-finger roll_outs. <br>\n",
    "  9.  Avoid extending nearer, shorter fingers to upper rows and longer fingers to bottom row. <br>\n",
    "  10. Avoid using the same finger. <br>\n",
    "  11. Avoid the upper and lower rows. <br>\n",
    "  12. Avoid skipping over the home row.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to account for (A-E) by the rules to generate the Flow24x24 matrix. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, left/right balance for (A) will be accounted for in part by <br>\n",
    "splitting up the most common keeps to left and right sides of the keyboard, <br> \n",
    "and rather than try to balance finger loads equally, <br>\n",
