    "  - **N-gram letter frequencies** (based on Google's book scanning project)\n",
    "  - **Flow factors** (affecting transitions between ordered key pairs) <br>\n",
    "    These factors are influenced by Dvorak's 11 criteria (1936)  \n",
    "    that can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "      - Alternate between hands and balance finger loads.\n",
    "      - Avoid using the same finger.\n",
    "      - Avoid the upper and lower rows.\n",
    "      - Avoid skipping over the home row (\"hurdling\").\n",
    "      - Avoid tapping adjacent rows (\"reaching\") with (same or) adjacent fingers.\n",
    "  - **Finger strengths** (peak keyboard reaction forces, in newtons) <br>\n",
    "      Based on  from <br>\n",
    "      \"Keyboard Reaction Force and Finger Flexor Electromyograms during Computer Keyboard Work\" <br>\n",
    "      BJ Martin, TJ Armstrong, JA Foulke, S Natarajan, Human Factors,1996,38(4),654-664.\n",
    "  - **Speed** (unordered interkey stroke times in milliseconds) <br>\n",
    "      \"Estimation of digraph costs for keyboard layout optimization\", <br>\n",

    "      Speed data were used for exploration of early key layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Engram criteria\n",
    "  1.  Assign 24 letters to keys that don't require lateral extension of index or little fingers.\n",
    "  2.  Group letters for common command shortcut keys (F,C,Z,Y,X,V) close together.\n",
    "  3.  Assign punctuation to keys that require lateral extension of index or little fingers.\n",
    "  4.  Assign easier-to-remember characters to the shift-number keys.\n",
    "  5.  Arrange letters so that more frequent bigrams are faster and easier to type.\n",
    "  6.  Balance finger loads according to their relative strength.\n",
    "  7.  Promote alternating between hands over typing with the same hand.\n",
    "  8.  Promote little-to-index-finger roll-ins over index-to-little-finger roll_outs.\n",
    "  9.  Avoid extending nearer, shorter fingers to upper rows.\n",
    "  10. Avoid using the same finger.\n",
    "  11. Avoid the upper and lower rows.\n",
    "  12. Avoid skipping over the home row.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Summary of steps\n",
    "  1. Optimize arrangement of the 12 most frequent letters in English across left and right sides.\n",
    "  2. Fill in the rest of the left side with the most common command shortcut characters.\n",
    "  3. Optimize arrangement of letters on the right side.\n",
    "  4. Add punctuation, and characters above the number row.\n",

    "### Optimize arrangement of the 12 most frequent letters across left and right sides\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the 12 most frequent letters in the English language \n",
    "(excluding C, which we group with other common command shortcut characters):\n",

    "                   E, T, A, O, I, N, S, R, H, L, D, (C), U\n",

    "Set an initial key position for E and T, the most common letters in English\n",
    "(left and right middle finger home row positions), compute all 3,628,800\n",
    "permutations of the remaining 10 letters, and determine an initial optimal\n",
    "arrangement of these letters according to our (strengh, speed, and flow) criteria.\n",
    "The resulting arrangement led to all vowels and H on the left:\n",

    "(which differ only by the order of Z and Y) because:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Z,Y,X,V is an extremely easy sequence to remember.\n",
    "  - Z will be in the standard position, which is also easy to remember.\n",
    "  - Undo (Z) & Redo (Y), and Cut (X) & Paste (V) are both common command sequences. \n",

    "  - F's most common bigrams (OF, FO, IF, FI) would be on the same line.\n",
    "  - Q is another option, but is the 2nd least frequent letter, \n",
    "      so should be relegated to a remote key location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step (3)\n",
    "### Optimize arrangement of letters on the right side\n",
    "\n",
    "Include 6 of the 8 remaining letters (M, P, G, W, B, K)\n",
    "and scramble letters on the right side in two stages.\n",
    "First, scramble letters in pairs of rows to find which letters \n",

    "   (here \"similar-looking\" to the numbers), is used as command-line shorthand \n",
    "   for the home directory (appropriate for upper left below the Escape key), \n",
    "   and is in the same position as the standard QWERTY key layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **'**  Single quotation marks are used to quote text for 'emphasis',\n",
    "   or to quote text within a quote.\n",
    "- **`**  One use of the backquote (or backtick, or grave accent) is to quote computer code.\n",
    "   In computer programming, it is used in an analogous manner as a single quote within\n",
    "   a quote, to quote code within code for command substitution (to replace a command with output).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"**  Double quotation marks are \"usually used to quote direct speech\", or so they say.\n",
    "- **\\**  The backslash is an escape character used to quote special characters in regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **,**  The comma is used to separate text, for example in lists, or to provide a pause.\n",
    "- **;**  The semicolon provides a stronger separation or pause; it can be used in place \n",
    "   of the comma to separate items in a list, especially if those items contain commas.\n",
    "   It can also be used to end a line of code in some programming languages.\n",
    "   \n",
    "- **.**  The period ends a sentence.\n",
    "- **:**  The colon similarly ends a statement but precedes something following:\n",
    "   an explanation, a description, a quotation, a list, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **|**  The pipe connects commands in computer code.\n",
    "- **/**  In addition to its use in mathematics, the slash connects \n",
    "   conjunctions/disjunctions/alternatives, or locations such as file paths or urls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **-**  The dash connects side-by-side words, or can surround a phrase for emphasis.\n",
    "- **_**  The underscore connects strings within variable or file names, \n",
    "   or can _underline a phrase_ for emphasis."

    "  - takes into account ease of transition between ordered pairs of keys\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dvorak et al. (1936) defined eleven criteria for the design and evaluation of keyboard layouts:\n",
    "1.  Deviation from the balance of hand and finger loads should be as low as possible.\n",
    "2.  Percentage of tapping with the same fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "3.  Percentage of tapping that includes top row should be as low as possible.\n",
    "4.  Percentage of tapping that includes bottom row should be as low as possible.\n",
    "5.  Percentage of tapping in the home row should be as high as possible.\n",
    "6.  Percentage of tapping by alternating hands should be as high as possible.\n",
    "7.  Percentage of hurdles with the same finger should be as low as possible.\n",
    "8.  Percentage of hurdles with adjacent fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "9.  Percentage of hurdles with remote fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "10. Percentage of reach with the same finger should be as low as possible.\n",
    "11. Percentage of reach with adjacent fingers should be as low as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Synopsis of above criteria for pairwise key presses when touch typing:\n",
    "(A) 1,6.    Alternate between hands and balance finger loads. <br>\n",
    "(B) 2,7,10. Avoid using the same finger. <br>\n",
    "(C) 3,4,5.  Avoid the upper and lower rows. <br>\n",
    "(D) 7,8,9.  Avoid skipping over the home row (\"hurdling\"). <br>\n",
    "(E) 10,11.  Avoid tapping adjacent rows (\"reaching\") with (same or) adjacent fingers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The approach here advocates the following related criteria (see above for complete list):\n",
    "  7.  Promote alternating between hands over typing with the same hand. <br>\n",
    "  8.  Promote little-to-index-finger roll-ins over index-to-little-finger roll_outs. <br>\n",
    "  9.  Avoid extending nearer, shorter fingers to upper rows and longer fingers to bottom row. <br>\n",
    "  10. Avoid using the same finger. <br>\n",
    "  11. Avoid the upper and lower rows. <br>\n",
    "  12. Avoid skipping over the home row.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will attempt to account for (A-E) by the rules to generate the Flow24x24 matrix. <br>\n",
    "Additionally, left/right balance for (A) will be accounted for in part by <br>\n",
    "splitting up the most common keeps to left and right sides of the keyboard, <br> \n",
    "and rather than try to balance finger loads equally, <br>\n",
    "we will weight finger use according to their relative strength.\n"
