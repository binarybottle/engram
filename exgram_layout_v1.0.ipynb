    "Letters are optimally arranged according to ergonomics factors that promote reduction of lateral finger movements and more efficient typing of high-frequency letter pairs, by minimizing the number of bigrams consisting of two different letters and typed with the same finger. The most common punctuation marks are logically grouped together in the middle columns and numbers are paired with mathematical and logic symbols (shown as pairs of default and Shift-key-accessed characters):\n",

    "## Why a new keyboard layout? <a name=\"why\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal history** <br>\n",
    "In the future, I hope to include an engaging rationale for why I took on this challenge.\n",
    "Suffice to say I love solving problems, and I have battled repetitive strain injury \n",
    "ever since I worked on an old DEC workstation at the MIT Media Lab while composing \n",
    "my thesis back in the 1990s.\n",
    "I have experimented with a wide variety of human interface technologies over the years --\n",
    "voice dictation, one-handed keyboard, keyless keyboard, foot mouse, and ergonomic keyboards \n",
    "like the Kinesis Advantage and [Ergodox](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/APXBR/latest/0) keyboards with different key switches.\n",
    "While these technologies can significantly improve comfort and reduce strain, \n",
    "if you have to type on a keyboard, it can only help to use a key layout optimized according to sound ergonomics principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used different key layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, etc.)\n",
    "for communications and for writing and programming projects,\n",
    "and have primarily relied on Colemak for the last 10 years. \n",
    "**I find that most to all of these key layouts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demand too much strain on tendons\n",
    "    - *strenuous lateral extension of the index and little fingers*\n",
    "- Ignore the ergonomics of the human hand\n",
    "    - *different finger strengths*\n",
    "    - *different finger lengths*\n",
    "    - *natural roundedness of the hand*\n",
    "    - *easier for shorter fingers to reach below than above longer fingers*\n",
    "    - *easier for longer fingers to reach above than below shorter fingers*\n",
    "    - *ease of little-to-index finger rolls vs. reverse*\n",
    "- Over-emphasize alternation between hands and under-emphasize same-hand, different-finger transitions\n",
    "    - *same-row, adjacent finger transitions are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "    - *little-to-index finger rolls are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "\n",
    "While I used ergonomics principles outlined below and the accompanying code to help generate the Exgram layout,\n",
    "I also relied on massive bigram frequency data for the English language. \n",
    "if one were to follow the procedure below and use a different set of bigram frequencies for another language or text corpus,\n",
    "they could create a variant of the Exgram layout, say \"Exgram-French\", better suited to the French language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Why \"Exgram\"?** <br>\n",
    "The name is a pun, referring both to \"n-gram\", letter permutations and their frequencies that are used to compute the Exgram layout, but because this approach and layout is intended in part to minimize same-finger bigrams, we are removing n-grams, hence \"x\"-gram."

The score for each bigram is a product of the frequency of occurrence of that bigram, the frequency of each of the bigram’s characters, and flow, strength (and optional speed) factors for the key pair.\n",

    "Since we want to assign the most frequent remaining consonants (M, F, P,...) to the most comfortable remaining positions, we need to match higher frequency consonants with the letters I, C, S, and T that form low-frequency bigrams. The only remaining consonants that form low-frequency bigrams when combined with the letter I are the letters Y and the lowest frequency letters (X, J, Q, and Z). The letter F, lower frequency letters W and V, and the same lowest frequency letters form low-frequency bigrams with the letter S. We will therefore assign Y to the vacancy above or below I, and F to the vacancy below S. The letters M, G, B, V, K, J, Q, and Z (in descending order of frequency) form low-frequency bigrams with the letter T, so we will assign M (the most frequent remaining consonant) to the vacancy above T. All of the remaining consonants except for Y and K form low-frequency bigrams with the letter C, so we will not commit to a letter assignment to any vacancy above or below C. The assignment of these three letters results in the following eight layouts:\n",

The first layout permits more inward rolls for high-frequency bigrams than the second (ND, NT, TR, and DR, but not RN). The second has fewer high-frequency same-finger bigrams (>15B vs. >24B, because the first has RM and WN), and shifts the greater load from the right ring to the stronger right index finger. \n",

    "For comparison with prior (Engram) experiments, the layouts below were generated without the above constraints related to placement of letters L, D, or C, and optimized placement of 15 letters in two stages, rather than 9 letters in one stage. It did require the four-consonant sequence on the right home row to consist of three high-frequency bigrams (such as NSTR = NS + ST + TR) and so permits one more inward-rolling, high-frequency bigram (NS) than the second layout above. The top-scoring layouts from the above and below approaches are identical on the left side and differ by the positions of seven letters on the right side (M, L, N, S, V, W, and F).

For the remaining two keys, we will assign two symbols that in modern usage have significance in social media: the hash/pound sign and the \"at sign\". The hash or hashtag identifies digital content on a specific topic (the Shift key accesses the dollar sign).
