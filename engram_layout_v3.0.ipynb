    "## Why a new keyboard layout? <a name=\"why\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personal history** <br>\n",
    "In the future, I hope to include an engaging rationale for why I took on this challenge.\n",
    "Suffice to say I love solving problems, and I have battled repetitive strain injury \n",
    "ever since I worked on an old DEC workstation at the MIT Media Lab while composing \n",
    "my thesis back in the 1990s.\n",
    "I have experimented with a wide variety of human interface technologies over the years --\n",
    "voice dictation, one-handed keyboard, keyless keyboard, foot mouse, and ergonomic keyboards \n",
    "like the Kinesis Advantage and [Ergodox](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/APXBR/latest/0) keyboards with different key switches.\n",
    "While these technologies can significantly improve comfort and reduce strain, \n",
    "if you have to type on a keyboard, it can only help to use a key layout optimized according to sound ergonomics principles. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used different key layouts (Qwerty, Dvorak, Colemak, etc.)\n",
    "for communications and for writing and programming projects,\n",
    "and have primarily relied on Colemak for the last 10 years. \n",
    "**I find that most to all of these key layouts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demand too much strain on tendons\n",
    "    - *strenuous lateral extension of the index and little fingers*\n",
    "- Ignore the ergonomics of the human hand\n",
    "    - *different finger strengths*\n",
    "    - *different finger lengths*\n",
    "    - *natural roundedness of the hand*\n",
    "    - *easier for shorter fingers to reach below than above longer fingers*\n",
    "    - *easier for longer fingers to reach above than below shorter fingers*\n",
    "    - *ease of little-to-index finger rolls vs. reverse*\n",
    "- Over-emphasize alternation between hands and under-emphasize same-hand, different-finger transitions\n",
    "    - *same-row, adjacent finger transitions are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "    - *little-to-index finger rolls are easy and comfortable*\n",
    "\n",
    "While I used ergonomics principles outlined below and the accompanying code to help generate the Engram layout,\n",
    "I also relied on massive bigram frequency data for the English language. \n",
    "if one were to follow the procedure below and use a different set of bigram frequencies for another language or text corpus,\n",
    "they could create a variant of the Engram layout, say \"Engram-French\", better suited to the French language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Why \"Engram\"?** <br>\n",
    "The name is a pun, referring both to \"n-gram\", letter permutations and their frequencies that are used to compute the Engram layout, and \"engram\", or memory trace, the postulated change in neural tissue to account for the persistence of memory, as a nod to my attempt to make this layout easy to remember."

    "We will assign letters to keys by choosing the arrangement with the highest score according to our scoring model. However, there are over four hundred septillion, or four hundred trillion trillion (26! = 403,291,461,126,605,635,584,000,000, or 4.032914611 E+26) possible arrangements of 26 letters (24! = 6.204484017 E+23), so we will arrange the letters in four steps, based on ergonomics principles. These consist of (Step 1) assigning the eight most frequent letters to different keys, optimizing assignment of the remaining (Step 2) eight most frequent letters, and (Step 3) eight least frequent letters (besides Z and Q), and (Step 4) exchanging letters. \n",
